# Python Bootcamp – Loops and Functions Assignment

This repository contains my Python practice code for learning **loops and functions**.
The exercises are part of a beginner Python programming bootcamp.

## Topics Covered
* For loops
* While loops
* Functions
* Conditional statements
* Simple mini project

## Part A: Loops

The following exercises demonstrate the use of loops in Python.
1. Print numbers from **1 to 10** using a `for` loop.
2. Print **even numbers from 2 to 20**.
3. Loop through a string and print each character of `"Python"`.
4. Print numbers from **5 down to 1**.
5. Use a **while loop** to print numbers from **1 to 5**.
These exercises help understand how loops work and how to repeat tasks in Python.

## Part B: Functions
This section focuses on creating and using Python functions.
1. Create a function that prints `"Hello Python"`.
2. Create a function that takes a number and prints it.
3. Create a function that takes **two numbers** and prints their sum.
4. Create a function that checks if a number is **even or odd**.
5. Create a function that prints numbers **1 to 5** using a loop.
These exercises help practice **function creation, parameters, and function calls**.


## Mini Project: Number Table Generator

This mini project creates a function that generates a **multiplication table** for a number.
Example output for number `3`:
3 x 1 = 3
3 x 2 = 6
3 x 3 = 9
and so on upto 3*10
